*42: The meaning to life, the universe, and everything*  

These are files that I use on my iPad in the Textastic app. I have taken the original copies and made some changes to them for my own use. Feel free to make suggestions. These are not complete or extensively modified as of yet but I will keep working on them and add more. 

#### Templates
- **html.json** — _A very basic html5 starting page with no content. Just the tedious setup tags._
- **threejs.json** — _Starting html file with initial_ `canvas` _setup. This is straight from the documentation._
- **javascript.json** — _A javascript file with_ `use strict` _included and tab-stops to start with creating a function._
    
#### CodeCompletion
- **js.json** — _Added_ `const` _and_ `let`. _Disabled_ `var`. _(More to come.)_
- **html.json** — _No changes_
- **css.json** — _No changes_
    
#### Theme
- ~~**Agila Neon Monocyanide.tmTheme** — _Colour tweaks. Plans to remove any unused components._~~
- **Bracula.tmTheme** — _Modified version of the Dracula theme. Changed the name slightly to avoid potential confusion._
