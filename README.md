These are files that I use on my iPad in the Textastic app. I have taken the original copies and made some changes to them for my own use. Feel free to make suggestions. These are not complete or extensively modified as of yet but I will keep working on them and add more. If you have any tips or suggestions for modifying and enhancing the Textastic editor for iOS, I would love to know!

#### Templates
- **html.json** — _A very basic html5 starting page with no content. Just the tedious setup tags._
- **threejs.json** — _Starting html file with initial_ `canvas` _setup. This is straight from the documentation._
- **javascript.json** — _A javascript file with_ `use strict` _included and tab-stops to start with creating a function._
    
#### CodeCompletion
- **three.json** — _Currently just a list of the constructors, properties, methods, attributes, etc... These will all autocomplete within javascript documents. They are not yet grammatically implemented._
- ~~**html.json**~~
- ~~**css.json**~~
    
#### Theme
- ~~**Agila Neon Monocyanide.tmTheme** — _Colour tweaks. Plans to remove any unused components._~~
- **Bracula.tmTheme** — _Modified version of the Dracula theme. Changed the name slightly to avoid potential confusion._

###### I do plan to spend time making this setup pristine to my liking and also bring GoCoEdit to the same level. Timeline? When I feel like it.
    
##### All credits towards the original creators and thank you for the hard work put into everything.
