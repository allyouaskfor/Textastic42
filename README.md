These are files that I use on my iPad in the Textastic app. I have taken the original copies and made some changes to them for my own use. Feel free to make suggestions. These are not complete or extensively modified as of yet but I will keep working on them and add more. If you have any tips or suggestions for modifying and enhancing the Textastic editor for iOS, I would love to know!

#### Templates  
- **html5.json** — _An HTML5 starting template._
- **html5adv.json** — _Another HTML5 starting template but this includes more tab-stops.
- <strike>**html.json** — _A very basic html5 starting page with no content. Just the tedious setup tags._</strike>
- **threejs.json** — _Starting HTML file with initial_ `canvas` _setup. This is straight from the documentation._  
- **javascript.json** — _A javascript file with_ `use strict` _included and tab-stops to start with creating a function._
    
#### CodeCompletion
- **three.json** — _Functions, constructors, properties, methods, etc... For use with THREE.js. These are not yet implemented as a grammar or follow any rules. They will just be offered as auto completions._
    
#### Theme
- **braculuh.tmTheme** — _Modified version of the Dracula theme._
- **braculuh-monocyanide.tmTheme** — _Brighter colours. Slightly modified from Monocyanide._
